##Usage##

*Important:* Master branch supports YouTrack 4.0 and higher. All further development will
only take place on this main branch. 

If you're looking for YouTrack 3.x support, please use the 3.x branch, although be aware that
this branch if frozen and only bug fixes will make it in. No new feature development. The main
reason for this is that the JSON from one version to another has changed quite a bit and makes a lot of new functionality possible in 4.0, which would require a lot of effort in previous versions.
